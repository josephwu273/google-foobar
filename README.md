## Setup and Virtual Environment

For reasons passing understanding, Google Foobar uses Python 2.7.13 (which was
deprecated 4 years ago as of writing this guide). The standard tool for creating
virtual environments (`venv`) only supports Python 3.

To create a virtual environment for Google Foobar, you must use `virtualenv`. A
how-to is specified in [this stack overflow guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64936086/create-virtualenv-in-python-2-7-on-windows-10-while-other-virtualenv-are-working)
